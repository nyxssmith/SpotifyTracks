# Spotify Song Tracker and Music Downloader

Proof of concept

Create a spotify dev account and change the api credentials in `main.py`
Run locally with `build_run.sh` and go to the main `/` route to authorize the spotify application to access your spotify info

Host whereever to download all songs that you listen to on spotify.
